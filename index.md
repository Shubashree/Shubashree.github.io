This website gives you a brief overview of my journey at Georgia Tech and prior. I would like to Quote Michelle Obama on something that I relate to her in a big way "To me, there  was magic in the learning. I got a buzzy sort of satisfaction from it". What drives me is my zest to learn new things and the satisfaction I get by applying my knowledge to deliver something. My only competition is myself. I strongly believe in teamwork and develop myself continuously by seeking inspiration from my surroundings. Scroll down to know more about my technical interests. Occasionally, I like to photograph whatever inspires me in my surroundings. I like to read books on my kindle as well.
